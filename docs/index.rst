Welcome to Homeassistant API!

Contributing Guidelines
--------------------------

We absolutely looooooooooove contributions!
This library has come a long way since its one-file humble beginning, on a Saturday afternoon with some our programming buddies.
But while much has been done already there is still much much much more to do!
Which is exciting!
If you're a developer that has an idea, suggestion or just wants to be helpful because you're an awesome person.
See our \*newly minted\* :ref:`Development and Contribution page <development_page>` for contribution ideas, guidelines, procedures and what to expect with your PR.
Happy developing!
We hope to see your PRs soon.
