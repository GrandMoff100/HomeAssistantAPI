## Python wrapper for Homeassistant's [REST API](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/api/rest/)

Here is a quick example.

```py
from homeassistant_api import Client

with Client(
    '<API Server URL>',
    '<Your Long Lived Access-Token>'
) as client:

    light = client.get_domain("light")

    light.turn_on(entity_id="light.living_room_lamp")
```

All the methods also support async!
